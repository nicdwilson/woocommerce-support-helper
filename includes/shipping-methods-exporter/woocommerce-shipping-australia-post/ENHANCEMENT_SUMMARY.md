# Australia Post Exporter Enhancement Summary

## Overview

The Australia Post shipping method exporter has been significantly enhanced to capture comprehensive settings and configuration data from the WooCommerce Australia Post shipping plugin. This enhancement ensures that all critical shipping configuration can be exported for support and migration purposes.

## What Was Enhanced

### 1. **Comprehensive Settings Capture**
- **Before**: Basic settings export with limited configuration data
- **After**: Full capture of all plugin settings including packing methods, box configurations, service customizations, and advanced options

### 2. **New Export Sections**
Added four new major export sections:

#### **Packing Configuration** (`packing`)
- Packing method selection (per-item, weight-based, box packing)
- Maximum weight limits
- Custom box definitions with dimensions and weights
- Default Australia Post box sizes
- Letter and envelope size configurations

#### **Service Configuration** (`services`)
- Custom service settings with adjustments and extras
- Satchel rate handling preferences
- Rate offering strategies (all rates vs. cheapest only)
- Available service options
- Extra cover and signature on delivery configurations

#### **Advanced Configuration** (`advanced`)
- Tax calculation preferences
- Origin postcode settings
- Tax status configurations

#### **Enhanced API Configuration** (`api`)
- Box packer library choice (Speed Packer vs. Accurate Packer)
- API key usage status (without exposing actual keys)
- Debug mode settings

### 3. **Data Sanitization Improvements**
- Enhanced box data sanitization to preserve essential dimensions while removing sensitive information
- Service data sanitization for custom service configurations
- Maintained security by never exporting API keys or sensitive credentials

### 4. **Comprehensive Documentation**
- Updated README with detailed export structure
- Added enhancement summary documentation
- Created comprehensive test suite for validation

## Technical Implementation

### **New Methods Added**
- `get_packing_settings()` - Captures packing method and box configurations
- `get_service_settings()` - Captures service customizations and options
- `get_advanced_settings()` - Captures advanced configuration options
- `sanitize_box_data()` - Enhanced box data sanitization
- `sanitize_service_data()` - Service data sanitization

### **Data Structure Improvements**
The exporter now organizes data into logical, well-structured sections:

```php
[
    'settings' => [
        'general' => [...],           // Basic method settings
        'shipping_zones' => [...],    // Zone-specific configurations  
        'api' => [...],               // API and library configuration
        'packing' => [...],           // Packing methods and boxes
        'services' => [...],          // Service configurations
        'advanced' => [...]           // Advanced settings
    ]
]
```

### **Security Enhancements**
- API keys are never exported in plain text
- Sensitive data is automatically filtered
- All exported data is properly sanitized
- Permission checks ensure data is only exported when appropriate

## Benefits of the Enhancement
